# MathLive `<math-field>` deep dive

Evaluating MathLive for a QTI 3.0 authoring tool: how it works, Froala integration, an equation builder, and a comparison with Wiris MathType.

| Milestone | Status | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| M1 Fundamentals | in review | [`docs/01-how-mathfield-works.md`](docs/01-how-mathfield-works.md), [`findings/roundtrip.md`](findings/roundtrip.md) |
| M2 Froala | not started | |
| M3 Equation builder | not started | |
| M4 Decision | not started | |

Surprises and version pins are in [`NOTES.md`](NOTES.md).

## Running the basic sandbox

```sh
pnpm install
cd sandbox/basic
pnpm dev            # demo page: field + LaTeX/MathML/speech panels + live event log
pnpm test           # Vitest in headless Chromium (set PW_CHROMIUM if Playwright's browser isn't installed)
pnpm probe          # regenerate findings/roundtrip-raw.json and findings/events-raw.json
pnpm size           # bundle-size table
pnpm runtime-check  # CSP / Trusted Types / fonts / many-equations timings → stdout (JSON)
pnpm ssr-check      # what MathLive offers under Node
```
